# DEPRECATED&mdash;PLEASE READ

*tl,dr: If you want to run Plane/Sailing, ignore this repo and go here instead: https://github.com/ianrenton/planesailing*

Versions 2 & 3 of Plane/Sailing located their client and server applications on different networks, and their code in different repositories.

As of Plane/Sailing v4, this is no longer the case&mdash;the two have been merged, and a single application now handles both the back-end data management & API, and serving the front-end HTML/CSS/JS.

This decision was made after watching several people struggle to get the system set up, and seeing their confusion over the various potential architectures. The majority of users just wanted one thing they could slap on a Raspberry Pi and have it all just work.

This repository contains the "old" server code as it was at the point before work on v4 began. v2 releases from this repository can still be used with client code v2 releases, and the same with v3 server & v3 client. I have kept this repository online to help the users of these older versions.

However, if you are a new user looking to install Plane/Sailing for the first time, or an existing user looking for the latest version, please go to https://github.com/ianrenton/planesailing and use the version downloadable from there.

Thanks.
